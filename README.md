## Introduction

This repository houses automated tests implemented with Playwright, an open-source Node.js library for automating browsers. Playwright offers a powerful set of features for automating web interactions across different browsers, making it an excellent choice for testing web applications.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **fixtures**: Contains any pre-defined data or states that are used across multiple tests.
- **node_modules**: Contains the dependencies required for running Playwright tests. (This directory is usually generated by npm or yarn and is listed in the .gitignore file.)
- **page-objects**: Contains Page Object Model (POM) classes that represent web pages and their elements. This promotes reusability and maintainability of tests.
- **tests**: Contains the actual test scripts written using Playwright to interact with the web application.

## Setup

To set up the project and run the tests locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lukasveselovsky/Playwright_basics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```sh
   cd Playwright_basics
   ```
3. Install dependencies.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can run the tests using the following command:

```sh
npm test
```
or
```sh
yarn test
```

This command will execute all the tests defined in the `tests` directory. You can also specify a specific test file or pattern to run.
